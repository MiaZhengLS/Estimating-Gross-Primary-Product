### About This Project

This is the code base of our paper "Estimating Gross Primary Product With Remote Sensing Data and Transformers". 

In this paper, we experimented with FT-Transformer (modified from https://github.com/aruberts/TabTransformerTF), transfer learning, remote sensing data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and FLUXNET data from FLUX stations (https://www.icos-cp.eu/ and https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/) to estimate gross primary product (GPP) at a large scale.
